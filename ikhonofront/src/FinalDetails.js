    ques1: "Are there any prerequisites for the course?",
    ans1:  "No,Any beginner who wants to build career as Web designer can take this course.",
    ques2: "Do we provide certification?",
    ans2:  "Yes, definitely you will get a course completion certificate which you can use on your professional platforms or resume.",
    ques3: "Can I use the course projects in my portfolio",
    ans3:  "Yes, youâ€™d be crazy not to in our slightly biased opinion! All projects are mentor led and guided and ready to use the minute you join. Many of our students tell us the projects they built while following along with our courses were what got them interviews and because they built the projects themselves, they could confidently explain and walk through their work during the interview. You know what that means? Job offer!",
    ques4: "How long does it usually take for me to build something and get hired?",
    ans4:  "Ultimately youâ€™re the only can that can control that. However, while everyone learns at a different pace, students who put in a couple hours each day to apply what theyâ€™ve learned should be able to confidently build their own projects and start interviewing in 3-6 months. We donâ€™t see just getting hired as the end goal though. Our advanced courses will also teach you the topics and skills you need to get promoted or hired as a senior developer.",
